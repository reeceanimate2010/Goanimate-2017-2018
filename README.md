# PHPWrapper
This is an API wrapper for GoAnimate's Legacy Video Maker, which had been retired on *19th December 2019, 03:10 UTC*.	Unlike other services that attempt to sole the same problem, this project allows the LVM to access data peristence and is very portable.  Please keep in mind that not all features designed to run on the original API work properly.
## How to Use
To access this service, install [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php) then clone/download this project.	Once done, unzip the folder, copy the path, and click on the start.bat file.
**When done, go to your web browser and navigate to `localhost`.**
