# VFProxy
 A PHP wrapper of the new VoiceForge API, which automatically converts it to MP3 using LAME for compatibility with the LVM.

## Parameters

* `?voice=`: Where you specify your voice. The voice arguments that will work can be found in the `VOICELIST.txt` file.
* `&msg=`: Where you specify what you want the TTS to say.
* `&download=true` (Optional): Downloads the file rather than embedding it in your browser.
